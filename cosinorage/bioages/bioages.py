class CosinorAge:
    """
    A class for calculating biological age using the CosinorAge model, which 
    integrates wearable-derived features such as MESOR, amplitude, and acrophase.

    Attributes:
        mesor (float): The MESOR (Midline Estimating Statistic of Rhythm) feature value.
        amplitude (float): The amplitude of the rhythm.
        acrophase (float): The timing of the peak in the rhythm.
        chronological_age (float, optional): The actual age of the individual. Default is None.
        fit (bool): Indicates whether the model has been fitted. Default is False.
        model (object, optional): A pre-trained model object, if available. Default is None.
        beta_1 (float): Coefficient for MESOR in the adjustment equation.
        beta_2 (float): Coefficient for amplitude in the adjustment equation.
        beta_3 (float): Coefficient for acrophase in the adjustment equation.
        alpha (float): Scaling factor for the adjustment equation.

    Methods:
        fit(): Placeholder method for model fitting. To be implemented.
        predict(): Calculates the CosinorAge adjustment and returns the estimated biological age.
